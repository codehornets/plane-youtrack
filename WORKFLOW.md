## Repo shape — read before doing anything else

This repo (`plane-youtrack`, local dir `youtrack`) is a fork of the Plane
project-management monorepo:

- **The default working branch is `preview`, not `main`.** Everywhere this
  workflow says "sync with the base branch", that means `origin/preview`.
  Branch from `origin/preview` and open PRs against `preview`.
- It is a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`).
  Use `pnpm`, never `npm`/`yarn`, and never regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml`
  wholesale.
- `apps/api` is a Django backend; the rest of `apps/` and `packages/` are the
  TypeScript/Next.js surfaces. Full local bring-up is Docker-based
  (`./setup.sh` + `docker-compose-local.yml`); do not assume the JS commands
  cover backend behavior.

Instructions:

1. This is an unattended orchestration session. Do not ask a human to perform follow-up actions.
2. Only stop early for a true external blocker (missing required tools, auth, permissions, or secrets). If blocked, record it in the workpad and move the issue according to the workflow.
3. Final message must report completed actions and blockers only. Do not include "next steps for user".

Work only inside your assigned workspace directory (the repository copy under
`~/symphony-workspaces/youtrack`). Treat every other path on this machine as off-limits, including
sibling repos under `/home/anga/workspace/projects/`. Never `cd` out of your workspace root, never
run `git` (or any command) against a `.git` directory outside it, and never run a script that
iterates over other directories (e.g. a "checkpoint all repos" style script). If you believe
cross-repo action is required, that is a sign you have the wrong scope — stop and record it as a
blocker in the workpad instead of acting on it. This instruction is enforced by convention only
(this host's sandbox does not guarantee filesystem confinement), so treat it as a hard rule, not a
suggestion.

## Prerequisite: Linear MCP or `linear_graphql` tool is available

The agent should be able to talk to Linear, either via a configured Linear MCP server or injected `linear_graphql` tool. If neither is present, treat that as blocked access: record it in the workpad and move the issue according to the workflow instead of asking a user to configure Linear.

## Default posture

- Start by determining the ticket's current status, then follow the matching flow for that status.
- Start every task by opening the tracking workpad comment and bringing it up to date before doing new implementation work.
- Spend extra effort up front on planning and verification design before implementation.
- Reproduce first: always confirm the current behavior/issue signal before changing code so the fix target is explicit.
- Keep ticket metadata current (state, checklist, acceptance criteria, links).
- Treat a single persistent Linear comment as the source of truth for progress.
- Use that single workpad comment for all progress and handoff notes; do not post separate "done"/summary comments.
- Treat any ticket-authored `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` section as non-negotiable acceptance input: mirror it in the workpad and execute it before considering the work complete.
- When meaningful out-of-scope improvements are discovered during execution,
  file a separate Linear issue instead of expanding scope. The follow-up issue
  must include a clear title, description, and acceptance criteria, be placed in
  `Backlog`, be assigned to the same project as the current issue (if any), link
  the current issue as `related`, and use `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends
  on the current issue.
- Move status only when the matching quality bar is met.
- Operate autonomously end-to-end unless blocked by missing requirements, secrets, or permissions.
- Use the blocked-access escape hatch only for true external blockers (missing required tools/auth) after exhausting documented fallbacks.

## Related skills

- `linear`: interact with Linear.
- `commit`: produce clean, logical commits during implementation.
- `push`: keep remote branch current and publish updates.
- `pull`: keep branch updated with latest `origin/preview` before handoff.
- `land`: once the completion bar below is met, explicitly open and follow
  `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`, which includes the `land` loop.

## Status map

This workflow has no dedicated human-review gate: once a ticket's own
completion bar is met, the agent self-promotes it straight to `In Review` and
lands the PR itself.

- `Backlog` -> out of scope for this workflow; do not modify.
- `Todo` -> queued; immediately transition to `In Progress` before active work.
  - Special case: if a PR is already attached, treat as feedback/rework loop (run full PR feedback sweep, address or explicitly push back, revalidate, then continue toward the completion bar).
- `In Progress` -> implementation actively underway. Once the completion bar
  is met, self-promote directly to `In Review` (there is no intermediate review
  state to wait in).
- `In Review` -> execute the `land` skill flow (do not call `gh pr merge`
  directly).
- `Done` -> terminal state; no further action required.

## Step 0: Determine current ticket state and route

1. Fetch the issue by explicit ticket ID.
2. Read the current state.
3. Route to the matching flow:
   - `Backlog` -> do not modify issue content/state; stop and wait for human to move it to `Todo`.
   - `Todo` -> immediately move to `In Progress`, then ensure bootstrap workpad comment exists (create if missing), then start execution flow.
     - If PR is already attached, start by reviewing all open PR comments and deciding required changes vs explicit pushback responses.
   - `In Progress` -> continue execution flow from current scratchpad comment.
   - `In Review` -> on entry, open and follow `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`; do not call `gh pr merge` directly.
   - `Done` -> do nothing and shut down.
4. Check whether a PR already exists for the current branch and whether it is closed.
   - If a branch PR exists and is `CLOSED` or `MERGED`, treat prior branch work as non-reusable for this run.
   - Create a fresh branch from `origin/preview` and restart execution flow as a new attempt.
5. For `Todo` tickets, do startup sequencing in this exact order:
   - `update_issue(..., state: "In Progress")`
   - find/create `## Codex Workpad` bootstrap comment
   - only then begin analysis/planning/implementation work.
6. Add a short comment if state and issue content are inconsistent, then proceed with the safest flow.

## Step 1: Start/continue execution (Todo or In Progress)

1.  Find or create a single persistent scratchpad comment for the issue:
    - Search existing comments for a marker header: `## Codex Workpad`.
    - Ignore resolved comments while searching; only active/unresolved comments are eligible to be reused as the live workpad.
    - If found, reuse that comment; do not create a new workpad comment.
    - If not found, create one workpad comment and use it for all updates.
    - Persist the workpad comment ID and only write progress updates to that ID.
2.  If arriving from `Todo`, do not delay on additional status transitions: the issue should already be `In Progress` before this step begins.
3.  Immediately reconcile the workpad before new edits:
    - Check off items that are already done.
    - Expand/fix the plan so it is comprehensive for current scope.
    - Ensure `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` are current and still make sense for the task.
4.  Start work by writing/updating a hierarchical plan in the workpad comment.
5.  Ensure the workpad includes a compact environment stamp at the top as a code fence line:
    - Format: `<host>:<abs-workdir>@<short-sha>`
    - Example: `devbox-01:/home/dev-user/symphony-workspaces/youtrack/COD-816@7bdde33bc`
    - Do not include metadata already inferable from Linear issue fields (`issue ID`, `status`, `branch`, `PR link`).
6.  Add explicit acceptance criteria and TODOs in checklist form in the same comment.
    - If changes are user-facing, include a walkthrough acceptance criterion that describes the end-to-end path to validate.
    - If the ticket description/comment context includes `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` sections, copy those requirements into the workpad `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` sections as required checkboxes (no optional downgrade).
7.  Run a principal-style self-review of the plan and refine it in the comment.
8.  Before implementing, capture a concrete reproduction signal and record it in the workpad `Notes` section (command/output, screenshot, or deterministic behavior).
9.  Run the `pull` skill to sync with latest `origin/preview` before any code edits, then record the pull/sync result in the workpad `Notes`.
    - Include a `pull skill evidence` note with:
      - merge source(s),
      - result (`clean` or `conflicts resolved`),
      - resulting `HEAD` short SHA.
10. Compact context and proceed to execution.

## PR feedback sweep protocol (required)

When a ticket has an attached PR, run this protocol before self-promoting to `In Review`:

1. Identify the PR number from issue links/attachments.
2. Gather feedback from all channels:
   - Top-level PR comments (`gh pr view --comments`).
   - Inline review comments (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr>/comments`).
   - Review summaries/states (`gh pr view --json reviews`).
3. Treat every actionable reviewer comment (human or bot), including inline review comments, as blocking until one of these is true:
   - code/test/docs updated to address it, or
   - explicit, justified pushback reply is posted on that thread.
4. Update the workpad plan/checklist to include each feedback item and its resolution status.
5. Re-run validation after feedback-driven changes and push updates.
6. Repeat this sweep until there are no outstanding actionable comments.

## Blocked-access escape hatch (required behavior)

Use this only when completion is blocked by missing required tools or missing auth/permissions that cannot be resolved in-session.

- GitHub is **not** a valid blocker by default. Always try fallback strategies first (alternate remote/auth mode, then continue publish/review flow).
- Do not stall on GitHub access/auth until all fallback strategies have been attempted and documented in the workpad.
- If a non-GitHub required tool is missing, or required non-GitHub auth is unavailable, leave the ticket in its current active state and post a blocker brief in the workpad that includes:
  - what is missing,
  - why it blocks required acceptance/validation,
  - exact human action needed to unblock.
- Keep the brief concise and action-oriented; do not add extra top-level comments outside the workpad.

## Step 2: Execution phase (Todo -> In Progress -> In Review)

1.  Determine current repo state (`branch`, `git status`, `HEAD`) and verify the kickoff `pull` sync result is already recorded in the workpad before implementation continues.
2.  If current issue state is `Todo`, move it to `In Progress`; otherwise leave the current state unchanged.
3.  Load the existing workpad comment and treat it as the active execution checklist.
    - Edit it liberally whenever reality changes (scope, risks, validation approach, discovered tasks).
4.  Implement against the hierarchical TODOs and keep the comment current:
    - Check off completed items.
    - Add newly discovered items in the appropriate section.
    - Keep parent/child structure intact as scope evolves.
    - Update the workpad immediately after each meaningful milestone (for example: reproduction complete, code change landed, validation run, review feedback addressed).
    - Never leave completed work unchecked in the plan.
    - For tickets that started as `Todo` with an attached PR, run the full PR feedback sweep protocol immediately after kickoff and before new feature work.
5.  Run validation/tests required for the scope.
    - Mandatory gate: run `pnpm check:lint`, `pnpm check:format`, `pnpm check:types`, and `pnpm build` (Turborepo will scope to affected packages) and treat any failure as incomplete work.
    - For changes under `apps/api` (Django), additionally run the backend's own test/lint flow rather than assuming the JS gates cover it.
    - Also execute any ticket-provided `Validation`/`Test Plan`/`Testing` requirements when present; treat unmet items as incomplete work.
    - Prefer a targeted proof that directly demonstrates the behavior you changed.
    - You may make temporary local proof edits to validate assumptions when this increases confidence.
    - Revert every temporary proof edit before commit/push.
    - Document these temporary proof steps and outcomes in the workpad `Validation`/`Notes` sections so reviewers can follow the evidence.
6.  Re-check all acceptance criteria and close any gaps.
7.  Before every `git push` attempt, run the required validation for your scope and confirm it passes; if it fails, address issues and rerun until green, then commit and push changes.
8.  Attach PR URL to the issue (prefer attachment; use the workpad comment only if attachment is unavailable). Open the PR against `preview`.
9.  Merge latest `origin/preview` into branch, resolve conflicts, and rerun checks.
10. Update the workpad comment with final checklist status and validation notes.
    - Mark completed plan/acceptance/validation checklist items as checked.
    - Add final handoff notes (commit + validation summary) in the same workpad comment.
    - Do not include PR URL in the workpad comment; keep PR linkage on the issue via attachment/link fields.
    - Add a short `### Confusions` section at the bottom when any part of task execution was unclear/confusing, with concise bullets.
    - Do not post any additional completion summary comment.
11. Before self-promoting to `In Review`, poll PR feedback and checks:
    - Read the PR `Manual QA Plan` comment (when present) and use it to sharpen test coverage for the current change.
    - Run the full PR feedback sweep protocol.
    - Confirm PR checks are passing (green) after the latest changes.
    - Confirm every required ticket-provided validation/test-plan item is explicitly marked complete in the workpad.
    - Repeat this check-address-verify loop until no outstanding comments remain and checks are fully passing.
    - Re-open and refresh the workpad before state transition so `Plan`, `Acceptance Criteria`, and `Validation` exactly match completed work.
12. Once the `Completion bar before In Review` below is fully met, move the
    issue to `In Review` yourself (self-promotion — there is no human review
    gate in this workflow), then immediately open and follow
    `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md` in a loop until the PR is merged.
    - Exception: if blocked by missing required non-GitHub tools/auth per the blocked-access escape hatch, stay in the current active state with the blocker brief and explicit unblock actions instead of self-promoting.
13. For `Todo` tickets that already had a PR attached at kickoff:
    - Ensure all existing PR feedback was reviewed and resolved, including inline review comments (code changes or explicit, justified pushback response).
    - Ensure branch was pushed with any required updates.
    - Then proceed to self-promotion per step 12.

## Step 3: In Review and landing

1. When the issue is in `In Review`, open and follow `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`, then run the `land` skill in a loop until the PR is merged. Do not call `gh pr merge` directly.
2. After merge is complete, move the issue to `Done`.

## Completion bar before self-promoting to In Review

- Step 1/2 checklist is fully complete and accurately reflected in the single workpad comment.
- Acceptance criteria and required ticket-provided validation items are complete.
- `pnpm check:lint`, `pnpm check:format`, `pnpm check:types`, and `pnpm build` are all green for the latest commit (plus backend checks when `apps/api` is touched).
- A self-review pass of the diff has been done and recorded in the workpad.
- PR feedback sweep is complete and no actionable comments remain.
- PR checks are green, branch is pushed, and the PR targets `preview` and is linked on the issue.

## Guardrails

- Never operate outside your assigned workspace directory — no other repo, no cross-repo scripts, no exceptions; treat any such urge as a blocker to report, not an action to take.
- The base branch is `preview`. Never branch from, merge from, or open PRs against `main` in this repo.
- If the branch PR is already closed/merged, do not reuse that branch or prior implementation state for continuation.
- For closed/merged branch PRs, create a new branch from `origin/preview` and restart from reproduction/planning as if starting fresh.
- If issue state is `Backlog`, do not modify it; wait for human to move it to `Todo`.
- Do not edit the issue body/description for planning or progress tracking.
- Use exactly one persistent workpad comment (`## Codex Workpad`) per issue.
- If comment editing is unavailable in-session, use the update script. Only report blocked if both MCP editing and script-based editing are unavailable.
- Temporary proof edits are allowed only for local verification and must be reverted before commit.
- Use `pnpm` for all dependency work; do not introduce `npm`/`yarn` lockfiles or regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml` beyond what the change requires.
- This is a fork of upstream Plane: prefer the smallest change that fits existing upstream structure, and avoid gratuitous divergence that would complicate future upstream merges.
- If out-of-scope improvements are found, create a separate Backlog issue rather
  than expanding current scope, and include a clear
  title/description/acceptance criteria, same-project assignment (if any), a
  `related` link to the current issue, and `blockedBy` when the follow-up
  depends on the current issue.
- Do not self-promote to `In Review` unless the `Completion bar before In Review` is satisfied.
- If state is terminal (`Done`), do nothing and shut down.
- Keep issue text concise, specific, and reviewer-oriented.
- If blocked and no workpad exists yet, add one blocker comment describing blocker, impact, and next unblock action.
